Q-1 What are lists and tuples? What is the key difference between the two?
Lists and Tuples are both sequence data types that can store a collection of objects in Python. 
The objects stored in both sequences can have different data types. 
Lists are represented with square brackets ['sara', 6, 0.19], while tuples are represented with parantheses ('ansh', 5, 0.97).

Q-2 How would you convert a string into lowercase?

We use the lower() method for this.
'AyuShi'.lower()
‘ayushi’

To convert it into uppercase, then, we use upper().
'AyuShi'.upper()
"AYUSHI"

Q-3 How do you get a list of all the keys in a dictionary?
mydict = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'e':5}
mydict.keys()

dict_keys([‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘e’])

Q-4 What is slicing?
Slicing is a technique that allows us to retrieve only a part of a list, tuple, or string. For this, we use the slicing operator [].
(1,2,3,4,5)[2:4]
(3, 4)

Q-5  What are functions in Python?
A function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called. To define a Python function, the def keyword is used.

Q-6 What is __init__?
__init__ is a method or constructor in Python. 
This method is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/ instance of a class is created. 
All classes have the __init__ method.

Q-7 What is a lambda function?
An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement.

Example:
1
2
a = lambda x,y : x+y
print(a(5, 6))

Q-8 What Does the // Operator Do?
In Python, the / operator performs division and returns the quotient in the float.
For example: 5 / 2 returns 2.5

The // operator, on the other hand, returns the quotient in integer.
For example: 5 // 2 returns 2

Q-9  What are Python Modules?
Files containing Python codes are referred to as Python Modules. 
This code can either be classes, functions, or variables and saves the programmer time by providing the predefined functionalities when needed. 
It is a file with “.py” extension containing an executable code.

Commonly used built modules are listed below:

os
sys
data time
math
random
JSON

Q-10 What is a dictionary in Python?
Python dictionary is one of the supported data types in Python. 
It is an unordered collection of elements. The elements in dictionaries are stored as key-value pairs. 
Dictionaries are indexed by keys.

Q-11 How to comment with multiple lines in Python?
To add a multiple lines comment in python, all the line should be prefixed by #.

Q-12 What is a map function in Python?
The map() function in Python has two parameters, function and iterable. 
The map() function takes a function as an argument and then applies that function to all the elements of an iterable, passed to it as another argument. 
It returns an object list of results.

For example:
def calculateSq(n):
return n*n
numbers = (2, 3, 4, 5)
result = map( calculateSq, numbers)
print(result)

Q-13 Write a command to open the file c:\hello.txt for writing?
Command:

f= open(“hello.txt”, “wt”)

Q-14 What does len() do?
len() is an inbuilt function used to calculate the length of sequences like list, python string, and array.

my _list=[1,2,3,4,5]
len(my_list)

Q-15 What does *args and **kwargs mean?
.*args: It is used to pass multiple arguments in a function.
**kwargs: It is used to pass multiple keyworded arguments in a function in python.

Q-16 What is the purpose of is, not and in operators?
Operators are referred to as special functions that take one or more values(operands) and produce a corresponding result.

is: returns the true value when both the operands are true  (Example: “x” is ‘x’)
not: returns the inverse of the boolean value based upon the operands (example:”1” returns “0” and vice-versa.
In: helps to check if the element is present in a given Sequence or not.

Q-17 How can you generate random numbers in Python?
This achieved with importing the random module,it is the module that is used to generate random numbers.

Syntax:

import random
random.random # returns the  floating point random number between the range of [0,1].

Q-18 What is Polymorphism in Python?
Polymorphism is the ability of the code to take multiple forms. 
Let’s say, if the parent class has a method named XYZ then the child class can also have a method with the same name XYZ having its own variables and parameters.

Q-19 Define encapsulation in Python?
encapsulation in Python refers to the process of wrapping up the variables and different functions into a single entity or capsule.
Python class is the best example of encapsulation in python.

Q-20 What is the difference between append() and extend() methods?
Both append() and extend() methods are methods used to add elements at the end of a list.

append(element): Adds the given element at the end of the list that called this append() method
extend(another-list): Adds the elements of another list at the end of the list that called this extend() method
